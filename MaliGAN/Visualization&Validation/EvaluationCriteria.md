## Evaluation
### Module Used
* BioPython
* modlamp
### Evaluation Criteria used to classify using Bio
- Net Charge<br>
The sum of the charges of each of the amino acids is called net charge. Antimicrobial peptides
have a positive net charge (of at least +2) at pH 7
- Isoelectric point<br>
Antimicrobial peptides have an isoelectric point close to 10
